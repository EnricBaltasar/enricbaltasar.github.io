<span style="font-weight: 400;">What if we could get 100,000s of people to learn a made-up language on Duolingo? 🤪</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That's exactly what I did, and I'll share with you the strategy and tactics to get a huge number of enrollees and grow your community. Get ready!</span>
<h2 id="why-it-happened-the-unlikely-success-story-behind-a-growth-engine">Why it happened: The unlikely success story behind a growth engine</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's reveal the cool kid: Today's protagonist is Esperanto, an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">artificial</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> language that seemingly nobody speaks and most have never heard about. 😅 Alright, that doesn't look great. But who cares? Let's get one million people to learn it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Esperanto hides amazing benefits. It's the world'</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s most creative language (it works like LEGO pieces!) and is super fun to learn. Also, scientific experiments prove it helps you learn new languages up to 50% faster while increasing your chances of success by about 1/3.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even if you convinced a million people to start learning today, the results would be close to zero. </span><b>The lack of qualified teachers and proper materials is one of the main growth constraints</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And unless you make learners an active part of the community, getting tons of them means little.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proof of this is that the law in Hungary requires university students to obtain an intermediate certificate of two foreign languages, which organically transforms into</span><a href="https://www.eszperanto.hu/hu-lernejo.htm"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">thousands of people opting for Esperanto each year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because that level can be reached in just 100-150 hours. And yet, they evaporate because the teachers don't teach them what to do with the language.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So honestly, </span><b>focusing on activation and retention</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes more sense than making a giant effort on acquisition and throwing people into the void.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what I did about it:</span>
<h2 id="leverage-a-strategic-partnership-with-duolingo-to-increase-completion-rates">Leverage a strategic partnership with Duolingo to increase completion rates</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Duolingo was becoming the world's most popular language-learning platform by offering </span><b>free online courses designed to maximise effectiveness and engagement through scientifically proven solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as gamification, high-frequency vocabulary, proactive reminders, etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That means it's easier to convince people to start a course there, and primarily that more people will finish it.</span>

{{< img src="duolingo-esperanto-spanish-course.png" >}}

<b>Completion rate is the most important metric in an online course</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it represents people are being successful, as I learned from a Platzi's co-founder. If you have a learning platform, you should consider setting a KPI (≈ target metric) for it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Duolingo advantage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using its technology to help fix a critical weakness in our community growth engine: The learner's journey.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Smith led the release of the English course, and I was on the founding team for the Spanish one, co-developing 1,947 lessons, packaged in 379 levels across 45 units. That was a total of 2,383 words and 8,464 sentences in the curriculum.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Put in plain text: If you finish that course, you can have a real conversation in Esperanto.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We got approximately </span><b>2,000 new enrollees and 100 course finishers every day, appointing to a 5% completion rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But hey, was that any good? Compare it with the astonishing <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-success-rate-of-learning-a-foreign-language-in-the-world-measured-by-the-number-of-people-who-learned-a-foreign-language-for-3-years-or-more-and-who-can-express-their-thoughts-in-a-foreign-language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">99.5% failure rate</a> of pupils who learn foreign languages at schools in the United States. Our course was crushing it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Duolingo invested money in our volunteer craft, e.g. doing professional voice recording of tons of sentences in a studio, and training machine learning models to implement voice recognition so that enrollees could practise.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adapting the materials to be dialect-friendly (localisation) was an important yet attention-greedy task.</span>

<b>Create massive exposure to increase trialists</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Duolingo was not just a technology-education partner, but a shop window (one-to-many model) thanks to its rapidly increasing user base (</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1309604/duolingo-quarterly-dau/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">34+ million monthly active users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now). Those who were using or heard about the platform could visit a </span><b>gallery of courses, which represented millions of dollars in free advertising for us</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also practiced </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cxeestismo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (be where your audience is) because we learned that polyglots are particularly receptive to our product for several reasons.</span>

<figure>{{< img src="meme-polyglots-esperanto.jpg" >}}<figcaption>Meme: "Me on Duolingo: Russian, Swedish, Japanese, Hungarian... Esperanto."</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a team of </span><b>paid specialists worked on giving it more visibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, its SEO team outreached many website owners to get backlinks (i.e., links to the course) to rank higher on Google.</span>

{{< img src="esperanto-duolingo-title.png" >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a community advocate, I learned that trials are of one the best-performing actions we could optimise for, and Duolingo made that easy and was helping us get 100,000s of them. That was a double-win multiplier: Many get hooked if they first try the language, while many more finish the course using Duolingo.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging other people's networks is a growth model that has worked many times in my life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're creating a course for a target price below $100, I recommend considering an external platform, mostly if you don't have a big database of emails yet because promotion is at least half of the job of creating a course.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Udemy promotes courses through paid ads, which you can consider as trading a commission of your sales in exchange for in-platform and off-platform visibility with the help of marketing specialists, as well as getting the course hosted for free.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, it tends to be better to create an impact in people's lives than to own everything (100% of nothing is still nothing).</span>
<h2 id="promote-a-new-messaging-to-highlight-benefits-and-growth">Promote a new messaging to highlight benefits and growth</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The course's landing page helped refresh and spread a new sales pitch, focused on the benefits, and far from the traditional messaging around the founder in the 19th century.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It contained social proof, a best-in-category identification (most popular planned language) and highlighted benefits.</span>

{{< img src="esperanto-spanish-speakers.jpg" >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This helped a lot to build more trust and authority because prior to Duolingo, it was hard to answer the </span><b>question of how many people speak</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it without relying on outdated and not very reliable sources.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the number of enrollees continued to climb, which built excitement around the language and created buzz. Also, it fostered a sense of community due to the achievements and contributions of not only the creators but also all those who talked about it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, since growth attracts more attention than big numbers alone, that also made for shiny media attention.</span>
<h2 id="generate-viral-growth-through-word-of-mouth"><b>Generate viral growth through word of mouth</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Way before the course was ready, a waiting list was opened offering visitors to be the first ones to try it, and we amassed 10,000s of pre-enrollees. This was followed by a soft launch in which only those on the waiting list were able to start the course.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The temporary exclusivity made many learners share on social media that they got a pass, which made others feel Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) if they weren't learning it. And when the hard launch arrived, those first enrollees encouraged their friends to join (languages are a social product after all).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Important to note, that also gave us time to refine the course before it was publicly available.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people kicked off their own initiatives, helped by the flow of new learners and speakers. For example, monthly events with only people who were learning the language on Duolingo, the</span><a href="https://www.universoparalello.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Universa Paralelo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> day event happening in many cities at the same time, social media movement marketing campaign when covid hit, and the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ-UOKyHO70"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Duolingo Generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video to show the faces of real people</span>

{{< img src="argentina-esperanto-duolingo.jpeg" >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another component of Product-Led Growth (PLG) was the success screens that encouraged learners to celebrate their accomplishments on the internet.</span>{{< img src="finished-esperanto-course-duolingo.jpg" >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, existing Duolingo users accessing the gallery of available courses (or in the incubator, too) was the main growth lever for the course to gain enrollees.</span>
<h2 id="foster-community-engagement"><b>Foster community engagement</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to immerse kursfinintoj (those who finished the course) into the Esperanto community, we promoted a</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230329203210/https://duolingo.esperanto.net/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">landing page to ship them a free copy of the two most read magazines in Esperanto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with worldwide delivery. That helped make the language more tangible as well as collect contact information.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I put my focus on the data to create a new </span><b>service to feed national associations and local organisers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with potential WhatsApp group members and event participants.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was done by full-time paid volunteers in the Netherlands following a simple process to gather the data into a Google Spreadsheet (that also operated as a kanban) and sending a template-powered email to the most relevant person in a global network database. That also strengthened the functional collaboration of the federation providing this new service.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both creators and those who were taking the course </span><b>participated in our Duolingo forum</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reply to other learners' questions and share their favourite resources, leading to valuable User-Generated Content (UGC).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also added </span><b>links to relevant social resources</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as national websites and</span><a href="https://telegramo.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online chat groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arranged by interest and location, e.g. across Facebook groups.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A small addition was</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1711812765736878"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">our own community on Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which got 4,200 members.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also spread the word of some great opportunities, like Konkurso Partoprenu IJK, a program that allows a few people each year to attend the largest youth festival for free.</span>
<h2 id="double-down-on-what-works-to-grow-faster"><b>Double down on what works to grow faster</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to make Duolingo's course the category leader, some colleagues took over to create a Portuguese and French version of the course afterward, with a Chinese one on the way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Organisations started to move away from recommending a ton of options to a few or just one on their website: Duolingo. That was a necessary step to reduce the</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">paradox of choice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> paradox (more options lead to paralysis, meaning fewer people started a course) and to palliate</span><a href="https://michaelgearon.medium.com/cognitive-biases-post-purchase-rationalisation-41056287eeb9"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">post-purchase rationalisation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (preventing people from switching between courses and not finishing any).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both offline teachers and groups of friends made the most of the app through Duolingo for Schools, which allowed everyone to create a class and compete to see who was winning and who was lagging behind. Interestingly, a few teachers took the tool as a primary tool and only met with students to reply to questions and practice.</span>
<h2 id="prevent-a-single-point-of-failure"><b>Prevent a single point of failure</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After some years of having the Esperanto courses on Duolingo, the company decided to switch from a crowdsourcing model to a fully in-house one. Sadly, the focus moved to the most profitable languages, and the continuous development of our courses stopped.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it was </span><b>easier to convince other platforms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to adopt Esperanto in the meantime. After all, if the biggest one had it, would they miss out? An example is</span><a href="https://languagedrops.com/language/learn-esperanto"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Drops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In parallel, we </span><b>continued with open-source projects to build internal capacity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, Georg Jähnig modernised</span><a href="https://esperanto12.net/es/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Esperanto In 12 Days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a course that focuses on high-frequency linguistic elements, and I made it available for Spanish speakers.</span>
<h2 id="keep-optimising-for-retention"><b>Keep optimising for retention</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe we still lost most of the community members we could have gotten if we kept optimising for activation and retention.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you learn what organisations like Greenpeace (largest environmental one) and AEGEE (largest one for students) do, it's easy to see what best practices they follow, as well as all the lost opportunities we were reproducing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we didn't have a central database where people could join (like</span><a href="https://greenwire.greenpeace.org.uk/s/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), didn't create a handbook on how to welcome and engage newcomers on a local level, didn't embed a kursfinintoj model inside other courses, and a very long etcetera.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of a real international strategy and tools for local activists are among the top reasons Esperanto is not a 10X success. Those help understand why a large number of learners didn't heavily impact the growth among traditional national and local groups.</span>
<h2 id="gamify-the-creators-experience"><b>Gamify the creators' experience</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone involved in crowdsourcing models knows the hardest part of getting people to take action is commitment. That's one of the reasons why Greenpeace's campaigns are so much about signing petitions instead of focusing on direct action.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Duolingo's model and lead volunteers avoided common mistakes by nudging through the system. This is what they did:</span>

<b>Co-creating a course required a long-time commitment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both before and after it was be released, so it all started with a direct question of how many hours per week each person could contribute. There was no way 1-2 people could do all the required work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people put in more hours than others, as you could expect, but there was a public </span><b>"hall of fame" page featuring the creators that highlighted the percentage each person contributed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This gamified the creators' experience because nobody wanted to be the lazy ass in front of thousands of people (we were at stake), and we nudged ourselves to keep committing several hours per week. Instead, we all wanted to be the hero.</span><b> </b>
<h2 id="crowdsourcing-doesn-t-mean-no-monetisation"><b>Crowdsourcing doesn't mean no monetisation</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The course was for free, however Duolingo monetized through paid perks for users. Unfortunately, paid certification was only implemented for a few languages despite the benefit for both monetisation, retention and distribution it could've driven.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Course creators initially did volunteering work, but the company compensated us a few years later when it dropped its integral scheme by switching to a centralised model, and paid authors – together with a home-delivered trophy.</span>

{{< img src="duolingo-trophey-res.png" >}}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe it was around $1,000 per each percentage authors contributed to. So if you were a course creator with 20% of the contributions, then you got $20,000, and tax-free because it was considered a donation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some teachers emerged on</span><a href="https://www.italki.com/en/teachers/esperanto"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">platforms like Italki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help Duolingo learners reach conversational levels, providing additional support. I personally cashed in some dollars with a two-people class.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also promoted my</span><a href="/esperanto/aprender/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">free online resources to learn Esperanto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and got some extra cash via ads through Google AdSense.</span>

<b>Duolingo paid the rent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both directly and indirectly.</span>
<h2 id="conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We built one of the most popular Esperanto courses with a peak at 367,000 simultaneous active learners (and probably 700,000+ enrollees over time), with at least 36,500 completions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on the top of Duolingo gave us access to technology and its network of users to both provide better education and get a lot of free exposure, reaching 1.7 million enrollees across its different versions. Plus, it continued to improve over time, like when shipping time-decay flashcards.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of the Esperanto course wasn't just about getting people to enrol through a one-to-many strategy, but about activating newcomers and building a sustainable community around the language.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is your lesson #1 when creating a learning community?</span>
