Unsolicited growth tip #1:

When people say "It's expensive", they aren't actually saying it costs a lot of money. Instead, what they mean is that it has low value for them.

That's why over 43 million American students spend crazily high sums to get a bachelor's degree and sacrifice multiple years of their lives for it. They do that because they see a high value, even if most of them don't know for how long they'll have to pay for their debt and what their monthly payment will be (source: Statista).

You'll still hear "My bachelor's degree is expensive as hell", but the fact is that people pay for it, and American students' debt is worth $1.75 trillion.

"It's expensive" is a black box that means very little. You need a different angle.

If you ask churning customers why they leave, the option "Expensive" should be reframed. And if you're selling something, ask questions about it, for example. (To expand: pricing objection handling; price bundling; step-by-steps; templates; etc.).

Agree, prohibitive prices exist. But more often than not, that's the wrong point. When selling, you aren't losing deals because of a high sum, but the reasons tend to be other ones, such as perceived value and perceived guarantee of success.

When you believe something has high value, you'll move mountains. And you should interact with the world seeking high value.

Takeaway: When someone says "It's expensive", try to understand how the offer could have a higher value for the other person. DON'T make the mistakes of leaving it there or focusing on reducing price.
