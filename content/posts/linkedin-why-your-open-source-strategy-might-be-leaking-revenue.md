Why your open-source strategy might be leaking revenue:

Many devtool companies treat open-source projects as product or engineering work.
In reality, it also involves distribution through search.

From my analysis, Google is the top referrer to GitHub.
That means developers mostly discover specific projects through Google, not by browsing GitHub.

Which is why how a repository is named, described, and structured directly affects how visible a tool becomes.

And guess what?

AI didn’t change this dynamic.
It doubled down on it.

LLMs rely on web search results and trusted technical sources developers already use.

If your open-source project isn’t easy to find or clearly understood through search, you aren't getting as much adoption as you could.

The good news?

This is within your control.

GitHub SEO is about making sure your open-source work gets found and understood.

I wrote a deep dive on this.
