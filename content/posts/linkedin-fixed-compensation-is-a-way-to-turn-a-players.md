Fixed compensation is a way to turn A-Players into job seekers.

But still, I see resistance from many CEOs to make work a game for everyone.

They think variable compensation is an executive privilege. Because if you need to think about it and build systems to attribute individual impact, it's only "worth it for the top people".

That's the wrong psychology.

How does one expect to strongly motivate and retain great people who have no visibility into how their actions create an impact?

This is exactly what I see when I audit marketing teams:

Top-down pay. No upside. No stakes.

Paying the same salary every month and expecting people to "just do their job" just because one is giving them their bread? That's obedience, not alignment.

And no, not all A-Players want to be managers. Most of the best ones are ICs. If you don't give them a path, they'll build their own elsewhere over time.

If you believe in "investing in people", then your compensation system should reflect it. Here’s how:

🧭 Reward loyalty:

- Annual anti-inflation raises (Thailand gets this right. Spain? Not so much.)
- Give people a quitting bonus after three months… or a raise. Let them choose. (Idea from Zappos' "Pay-to-Quit" program)

📈 Create real upside:

- Offer revenue share. Phantom shares are overhyped and under-understood.
- Give exponential quota rewards, not binary bonuses.
- Add delayed equity after mutual trust is built.
- Run performance reviews every six months, like Meta does. If there's no clear path to win, stats clearly indicate that staying at your job has a loyalty tax after two years.

Variable compensation isn't perfect. But it builds a system that compounds: one where people stay because they see a future. Not because they fear the alternative.
