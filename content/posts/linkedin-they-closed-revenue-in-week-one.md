They closed revenue in week one.

Not because they had some “sales DNA” (Fresh grads. No experience).

But because they knew who to talk to and what to say from day one.

We gave them a map.
Not ICP slides.
Not BANT.

A framework. It reveals how companies actually behave and what they’re ready to act on today, not just what job titles they have.

Let’s ground this in a real example.

Do you know LaunchDarkly?

It’s a tool to control which users see which features.
In technical terms: It’s a feature flagging platform.
Sounds boring?

Here’s what it means:

Ship faster.
No more “Let’s wait until <insert excuse here>”.
Learn quicker.
Kill silos.
Revenue proves the point.

That’s why some companies grow like hell. And others… don’t.

But here’s what most that Go-To-Market teams miss:

You can’t sell that dream to just any company that might benefit.
(Not unless being ghosting is your hobby).

That’s why we implemented the Scenarios Framework.

Instead of assuming every Product Manager or Growth Lead will get value from “feature flags”, you match your pitch to where they are today.

Because selling by ICP alone?
It’s like being a recruiter who sends a developer a job because they wrote “JavaScript” once in 2021.

You must see your customers through a different lens: levels of sophistication.

Scenario 1: No flags used.
Scenario 2: Homegrown hacks (hardcoded flags).
Scenario 3: Basic open-source tool implemented.
Scenario 4: Advanced tool installed, barely used.
Scenario 5: Power user.

Each one hears a different story.
Each one wants a different win.

You solve real problems, one stage at a time.

Say the right thing to the right person, and you don’t need follow-ups.
You need a contract.

And if you think that’s it, we’re just getting started.
There are still a few steps to make this work inside your company.

More on this soon.

I break down how to market to engineers without sounding like an outsider.
Follow if you’re tired of “awareness campaigns” that lead nowhere.
