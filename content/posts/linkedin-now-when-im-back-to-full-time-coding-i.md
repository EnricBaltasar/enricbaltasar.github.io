Now when I'm back to full-time coding (I hadn't done it since my first startup), I wanted to share a few lessons:

1. The gap of what you don't know that you don't know is huge.

I need to constantly tell myself "Don't tackle that one more thing, even if it looks incredibly reasonable and exciting".

2. The only metric that matters is getting results, and you don't get results if you don't f** ship.

The point isn't going live, but nothing matters unless that happens.

And contradictory as it sounds, I need to lower my bar for "good enough" if I want to make real progress even if, from a marketing perspective, I'd say it's not good enough. That’s the solo reality.

Disclaimer: Shipping fast ≠ creating garbage. It's about learning fast and shortening the feedback loop in the early stages.

3. Building is so fascinating, but companies don't grow just because their product is good.

People need to try it. My sweet spot is treating distribution like building a system. That's why I lean on SEO and other compounding loops.
