It's easy to forget how much you've learned, and how much time and effort it took, even with simpler matters.

An example for trips:

I've spent 100s of hours in planes, so I was about to recommend some family members how to choose the best seat in a long-distance flight. I thought I'd just share a couple of points, but ended up with a drawing and a seven-step process 😂.
