Most companies still get this workflow wrong and lose new signups:

1. User enters email
2. You say “check your inbox”
3. They can’t find it (spam, promotions…) or get distracted by other emails
4. They forget about you

That’s conversion money burned.

But why let users get lost in their inbox?

The solution is deep links.

Instead of dumping people into Gmail’s homepage, you send them straight to the only email that matters based on configurations, such as:

- Go to the right Gmail account
- Search in all email folders
- Display your emails only
- Filter by recent emails and specific subject line

No more “didn’t see it”. No more new users lost forever. Just a direct route to the right email.

And Gmail has 2.5B+ users. Too big to ignore.

I’ve broken down the full cheatsheet of Gmail deep links (from basic to advanced) so you can copy-paste and fix your cross-channel UX right away.
