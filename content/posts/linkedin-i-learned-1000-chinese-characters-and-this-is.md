I learned 1,000+ Chinese characters, and this is what I discovered:

You should ditch the traditional advice that focuses on repetition. Instead, hack the way your brain interprets the visual input of characters.

If you're on a mission to learn either Chinese or Japanese, I've recorded an overview of my journey, exploring and combining different methods and tools that will save you hundreds of hours.

• You after the video: "I'm confident I could actually learn it."

I'll leave a link to the video in the first comment.
