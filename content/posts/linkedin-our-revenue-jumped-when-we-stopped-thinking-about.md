Our revenue jumped when we stopped thinking about ICPs.

Imagine you sell a product feedback tool.
Your ICP?

B2B SaaS companies in the US making $1M to $5M ARR, with a Product Manager responsible for gathering feedback and prioritizing what gets built.

Sounds focused, right?

Now picture this:
- One company tracks feedback in Google Sheets.
- Another runs everything through Productboard.

Same ICP on paper.
Totally different reality.

And while my team kept saying “I understand our audience”, you could tell… they didn’t.
The message didn’t land. They didn’t sound like experts.

Not because they were clueless, but because they were shooting out messages like confetti and hoping someone caught one.

We were talking to people that didn’t need our solution or needed a different one.
And when we were talking to the right people, it was just in the wrong way.

That’s when everything changed.

I got slapped by truth.

A GTM and messaging tool made me live their day-to-day. 

Same team, same product.

Revenue took off.

The name?

The Scenarios framework.

Get better segmentation. Higher conversions.
