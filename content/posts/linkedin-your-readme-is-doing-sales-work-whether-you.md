Your README is doing sales work, whether you want it to or not.

When developers look for tools, search engines don’t understand code.
They understand text.

On GitHub, Google, and even AI systems, that text mainly comes from:
- the repository name
- the description
- the README

These elements are some of the strongest signals used to decide what a project is and when it should appear in search results.

That’s why a README isn’t just documentation.
It also behaves like a landing page.

It decides whether your product is even considered, and strongly influences what happens next.

Whatever you put there becomes the reference point.

This is one of the most underestimated growth levers in devtools.
Full breakdown in the comments.
