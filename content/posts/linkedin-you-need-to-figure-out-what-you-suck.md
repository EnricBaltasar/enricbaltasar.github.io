You need to figure out what you suck at or are just ok if you really want to create impact.

Only then you can choose between two options: 

A. Set a goal to improve if it really matters to you.
B. Ignore it and focus on your strenghts.

For example, I’m amazing at connecting the dots, and less at remembering everything. So I have a whole personal operating system to optimise what I’m great at while minimising what I’m less good at.

I found it fascinating learning about the psychology of memory to discover our working memory can remember up to 2-3 things well. Then, it exponentially worsens.

That’s why phone numbers are mostly presented in chuncks of two or three digits.

Whenever possible, I like to organise my life with the same simplicity. Better to do a few things well than many bad.

For instance, I pick my top 2-3 prioritities for the week.

Three items is too limited often. But in that case, I prefer to keep up with the system and put the extra elements into boxes: I have three items, and I put up to three more inside each. I keep it to maximum three levels.

You get more mental clarity in your direction, plus actions are easier to communicate and follow up.

I call this the rule of threes. 

What are you trying to improve on currently?
