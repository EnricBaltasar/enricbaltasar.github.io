<p class="pseudo-h3">I reverse-engineer everything.</p>
Languages. Movements. Markets. People.<br>
I can't help it and I'm not sorry.

I once got 300,000 people to learn a language most called "dead". Not because I was persuasive, but because I understood the mechanism.

I raised half a million euros for causes I believed in.<br>
Spoke at the European Parliament before 25.<br>
Then I walked away.

Social movements are slow.<br>
Technology scales faster.

I wanted systems that work without me in the room.

I've lived across four continents.<br>
Learned seven languages.<br>
Sat through four years of university lectures I wasn’t even enrolled in, because I wanted to understand how systems change behavior.

The pattern never changed:

Find what actually moves people.<br>
Find the constraint others ignore.<br>
And move the system.

Activism was one vehicle.<br>
Education was another.<br>
Technology turned out to be the fastest.

I’m not loyal to industries.<br>
I’m loyal to what works.

Now, I run [Nakora](https://nakora.ai).<br>
