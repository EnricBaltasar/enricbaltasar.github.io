## Social post intro

One of the most powerful persuasion techniques I've learned is "agency framing".

When I lived in Egypt, I was fasctinated to realise how much people valued professions like doctor and engineer. But if you asked the practitioners, many didn't like their jobs.

There was a strong disconnection between their daily job activities and the status they wanted for themselves or their kids. And this often reached the point of parents forcing their children to take those career paths.

The same situation happened in other underdeveloped or developing countries, where I've spent several years of my life.

This love-hate situation helped me realise people care about status more than I believed (or wanted to believe). So now my question was: How could I use this insight?

## The Effective Persuasion Technique "Agency Framing"

It turns out that if you frame an activity (e.g., to eat healthy) as part of an identity (healthy person), you're far more likely to convince someone when selling whatever you sell (home-delivered food, gym...).

You turn a painful activity into a status, catchy lifestyle, or mission.

Compare these two sentences and tell me which one raises your arousal the most:

A. Do you want to lose or to win?
B. Do you want to be a loser or a winner?

I bet option B.

That's why we talk about digital nomads (the fancy lifestyle) instead of working remotely (the cruel activity for many). Or why people want to be cool entrepreneurs, but running a startup can easily ruin their life.

Funnily, many mothers deeply dislike mothering when their baby is born because their life negatively transforms (emotional exhaustion, social isolation, financial stress, career impact, and so on). However, they're happy because they feel fulfilled and their gained identity as a mother. There's even a biological/chemical element in place: Mothers generate larger amounts of specific hormones, such as oxytocin ("the love hormone") that plays an essential role in mother-child attachment after birth.

It's no mystery why "senior" is one of the most subjective and fake additions to a title in the tech industry. Some backend developers become senior backend developers in 2 years! How come? But the sure thing is we all want to be perceived as seniors.

We could simplify this topic as identity formation. However, you'd be wrong because it goes beyond:

When I was an international human rights activist, we sometimes used the term "linguistic democracy". You might have no idea what it is, but can't deny it feels important. The reason is that we absorbed the social valuation of "democracy". It's about creating a word or term for an imaginary entity/agency, kind of like creating a micro-religion.

If you're in the task of naming a book, you can use this idea to sell more. For instance, after the Lean Startup method was popularised, a pile of other books and approaches with inspired names appeared, such as "El método Lean Legal" (the legal lean method). Just take a look at the article "Lean" on Wikipedia in English and you'll feel overwhelmed.

A study by Bryan et al. (2011) found that using identity-based language ("Be a voter") was more effective in increasing voting behaviour than action-based language ("Vote").

If you want to advertise travel, change your words: Instead of the tagline "Explore the world", say "Become a world explorer". Then you sell the means, the roadmap or both.

Interested in marketing? → Then sell the dream of becoming a marketer → Next, offer a job to become a marketing manager (EVEN if you are the manager of no one!).

Another use of agency framing (I usually spot patterns and makeup terms to remember them better) is this powerful approach:

Given that reality is created by comparison, you can stack agencies! For example, you can go ahead like this:

There are three types of people (or entrepreneurs, or whatever):

- **Name of type 1:** Those who…
- **Name of type 2:** Those who...
- **Name of type 3:** Those who...

The first is bad, the second is less bad, and the third is exciting. Then, you ask: Which type do you want to be?

I assure you this works like a charm. And if you think about it, you can even create a free quiz to generate leads.

Lastly, if you manage a team, I recommend learning about the labelling theory to inspire you to become a more effective leader, as well as reading the book Atomic Habits for tips on identity formation as a lever to foster other people's personal growth.

Now, I'm curious to ask you: What identity motivated you at some point in your life?
