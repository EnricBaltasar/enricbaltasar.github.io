I call this "My level of obsession".

Some years ago, I came across a blog that illustrated an amazing perspective on marketing and was shockingly detailed. I thought: These guys must be saving me 100,000s of euro in mistakes or years of trial-and-error.

That blog was just amazing. So I spent over 5 weeks using my entire free time reading every single article and taking notes, also expanding on what I was learning there. In retrospect, I can say that time was an excellent investment. Pure gold!

Today, I went to check my learning notes and realised I wrote 133 pages.

Yes, I wrote a bible.

But that's who I am. When I'm interested in something, I'll reach the bottom of the ocean and win the war.

What are you obsessed with at the moment?
