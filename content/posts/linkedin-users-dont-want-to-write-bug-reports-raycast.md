Users don’t want to write bug reports. Raycast makes them do it anyway, while creating a distribution loop.

If you don’t know Raycast yet, it’s a Mac productivity tool that replaces Spotlight.

Like any tool, errors happen. But instead of hiding them, Raycast turned them into free visibility.

Here’s how:

When you see an error message and click to learn what happened, a tiny window opens with details but your attention goes straight to a call-to-action: “Report Error”.

Click it, and you’re taken to GitHub with a pre-filled bug report. Two clicks, and you’ve contributed, while feeling more engaged with the product.

That’s not the best part yet.

When that issue is published, it shows up on your public GitHub profile and in your followers’ feeds. Replies multiply the reach. You’re telling the world you love Raycast.

A tiny UX choice turned bug reports into a distribution loop in a community with over 150M monthly active users.

Great community-driven growth playbooks are made of small tactics. This is one of them.

Kind of wild that a bug can become marketing. Makes me wonder what other “mistakes” could be growth loops.
