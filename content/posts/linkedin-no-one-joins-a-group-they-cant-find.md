No one joins a group they can't find.

When I launched my first startup with Pablo Régulo Aldaz Aldaz, we had no audience.
No budget to buy one either.
So we created it, from scratch.

Two Facebook groups about real estate.
They didn't look special.
But they now have 84,000+ members.

The secret? 

We didn't just focus on content.
We focused on discovery.

Because social media platforms are search engines, too.
So we obsessed over what people search for.

But there was a problem.
Facebook won't tell you what people type in the search bar.

So I built a list of top-performing communities.
Studied their names, member counts, rankings, engagement.
Found patterns.

But if you want to beat the giants, you can't just copy them.
You have to outsmart them.

So I did something different:
Used Google search data (via Ahrefs) as a proxy for what people likely search on Facebook.
Same intent, better data.

We also localized the strategy.
"Condo" is big in Thailand.
Not in Spain.

And since many search engines are less sophisticated than Google, I used exact-match phrases for the group names and placed secondary terms where it mattered.

The result?
We ranked inside Facebook.
People found us.
And we had a community even before we had a product.

I've reused the same playbook for YouTube, too.
Even though specific keyword research tools exist, I still prefer Google as the source of truth.
Bonus: Google is now pushing videos in traditional search results pages more and more.

Lesson:
If you're starting from zero, don't just guess.
Use Google search data to win where others can't see the numbers.
