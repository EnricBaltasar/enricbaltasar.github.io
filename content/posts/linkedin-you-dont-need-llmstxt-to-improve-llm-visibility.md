You don’t need llms.txt to improve LLM visibility.

You don't need creating .md mirrors of your pages either.

If your goal is to be mentioned and cited in LLM answers, focus on actions like:
- Publish high-signal pages that solve real user questions
- Earn third-party mentions
- Improve positions on search engines

Less sexy. But it works.

I can't say the same about llms.txt (or the growing family of "LLM SEO hacks").
