This tiny issue cost us 1% of our users.

I was checking our user base and spotted emails like:
davidmonroe@gmal.com, andrewtt@yahho.com.

Real people. Wrong domains.

They weren’t getting any of our emails.
No onboarding, no updates, no follow-ups.
Just… gone.

Out of curiosity, I wrote some rules to catch these typos.
Then pulled the numbers.

The result surprised me.

More users were affected than I thought.
Way more.
About 1%.

Worse: Our email deliverability was being hurt for all users.

So we addressed it.

No shame-y “Oops! Invalid email.”
Just… fixed it under the hood by rewriting them.
Invisible and effective.
