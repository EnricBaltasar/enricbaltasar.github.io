Community engagement is not a leap — it's a ladder.

When I was leading a network of 60 countries among national sections and antennas, I spotted an interesting pattern: Leaders from different geographical levels often struggled to activate members to pass on responsibilities, meaning short-lived groups or limited growth.

I interviewed a bunch of people and found a common breaking point:

It turns out many of them expected that newcomers would be automatically interested in contributing somehow. After all, they had already joined the community! Meanwhile, the new participants felt unready, insecure or just didn't see the value of it.

I'll handle the first mental objection today: Feeling unready. And the igniting question is: Do our members know they can offer something worthy and with very low commitment?

In our case, most had the impression that unless they mastered our topic, they couldn't do anything. Therefore, the learning curve was the fish that bites its tail.

But was that a problem, really?

I turned to explore what successful organisations came up with and participated in them, such as Greenpeace (world's largest environmental organisation), AEGEE (largest one for university students), the European Youth Forum, several local political groups and so on. What I found was the opposite of what we were doing:

For example, The Cube (vegan activism) just requires you to wear an anonymous Vendetta mask in the street with other people and hold a screen projecting the reality of slaughterhouses. Then, someone takes pictures, and you go have dinner together after the performance.

An even more enlightening example is a debate group that welcomes you to get started promoting other political discussions you had no idea about with just a 1-minute preparation. Wow!

However, how could we implement those for our specific movement?

We did a brainstorming exercise to come up with actions people could take. However, the outcome was very poor. I failed.

Then, I realised the problem was not in gathering people together to think but in my job as as a group facilitator. People often need structure to create more meaning, and I needed to make it explicit. Kinda like if I created a game map, and the participants were the ones responsible for unhiding the black areas of the map.

This was my new approach:

Let's think of ordinary activities we do (like managing a WhatsApp group), and break down them into atomic tasks (such as keeping spam under control). Then, coming up with micro-role names (e.g., "Moderator", "Mentor", etc.).

All just for a WhatsApp group!

Then, we added a last dimension: The minimum requirements of atomic roles, i.e. one-liners in a bullet point list of what is the bare minimum someone would need to do to be successful.

As a recap of the brainstorming flow:
Activity → Tasks → Roles → Minimum requirements.

Have a growth day!
