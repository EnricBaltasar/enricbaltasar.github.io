Please don't tell me you still believe the future of SaaS is all-in-one.

That might sound counterintuitive, but here's what years growing technical SaaS companies taught me:

Many marketers sound like ChatGPT: Looks good but isn't good.

Marketers pretend (or genuinely believe) they understand customers.
Engineers don't prioritize them (often because of company culture).

That's why I was shocked when a tiny startup in our space started growing faster than anyone.

Their product was simple.
No magic AI. No 50 features. Just deep integration.

It didn't require you to change your behavior. It just plugged into how and where you already worked.

No learning curve. No emotional resistance. And no internal debates.
Just: "Oh, this works with what we already use.".

And that's not even the best part.

Because they built on top of other SaaS tools, those tools promoted them in return, which created a distribution flywheel, increasing visibility and trust.

You should sell software the way you build it.

Then, partnerships improved the technology and raised the bar for new players.

Marketers often think distribution through product means referrals. But in B2B, the real leverage comes from becoming indispensable inside someone else's workflow.

The best teams won't build bigger products.

They'll build like octopuses: a smaller body (tight team, clear focus) and more tentacles (integrations, partnerships, ecosystem-driven growth).

The best SaaS companies will win by integrating, not by adding features.
