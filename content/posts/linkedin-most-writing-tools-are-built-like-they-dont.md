Most writing tools are built like they don't know what writing is.

They treat it like typing.
Or worse: formatting.

You open the app, and suddenly:
Toolbars. Notifications. Block menus.
"Helpful" features that only help you lose focus.

Google Docs assumes you're collaborating, not thinking. You open a doc and see toolbars, menus, and a big blue "Share" button.

WordPress treats you like a web designer, not a writer. It asks you for layout decisions before you've written a sentence.

Notion assumes you're organizing, not expressing. So you end up structuring your thoughts before you've had them.

Writing doesn't work like that.

Writing is intense.
When you're in it, nothing else exists.
When you're out of it, good luck getting back in.

If you're building for creators, don't just remove friction.
Remove temptation.

Don't just build tools.
Build flow states.

Because if your user is doing deep work…
Your job is not to "engage" them.
It's to disappear.

Make it easier to stay in the work, and people will come back.
Not because of dopamine.
Because of trust.

Medium feels like writing on paper.

I've written a whole book on Medium.
Not to publish.
But to help me think.

No noise.
No distractions.
No blinking UI asking if I want to embed a video.

Most tools compete for your attention. Medium gives it back.

The words you're reading now? I crafted them there.

It gives me something few tools do:
Control over my attention.

Look at the screenshot. There's nothing but a blinking cursor placed where it should be: the content, not the title.

Just begin.

That's care in product design.

It's a blank page that respects writers.

And I get those people who buy single-purpose physical devices.
Like the ones who read on a Kindle to prevent distractions.

They're not stuck in the past.

I opened the publishing platform. And suddenly, writing felt… like writing again.

Lesson?

You don't need to add more.
You need to remove what was in the way and protect the moment your user is in.

When someone writes, they're not using a product.
They're facing themselves.

Design for that.
And you won't need to convince anyone to come back.
