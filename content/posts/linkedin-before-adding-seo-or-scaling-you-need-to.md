Before adding SEO or scaling, you need to understand why conversions are low.

A company came to us asking for SEO, but the real issue wasn’t acquisition.

Their revenue problem came from positioning.
A tool for everything, for everyone.

Great product, wrong go-to-market.

And this is where many companies have issues (either at $0 or after several million ARR):

- Marketing optimises for signups
- Sales optimises for closes
- Product optimises for shipping
- CS optimises for survival

All reasonable in isolation and easy to manage.
But collectively, the business fails or barely grows.

When incentives point in different directions, every new channel magnifies the problem.

The solution isn’t adding more operations, but aligning end-to-end (which is different than asking people to do everything).

A quick test:
- Does your PPC agency run ads without owning landing pages?
- Does your SEO partner ignore messaging?
- Does Sales close customers who never activate?

You don’t have partners.
You have output vendors.

I've seen many companies looking for cheap "keywords and articles", to then see no return.

Every “zero to scale” experience has reinforced the same pattern:
Growth comes from ownership, not isolated activities.
