My AI avatar generated $3M+. This is what happened.

When I was starting my career, every piece of content we published (blog posts, emails, social replies) had to be signed off by my manager.

Real person, real reputation on the line.

But the big problem was that she wanted to review everything manually.

Every. Single. Word.

What should have taken minutes expanded into days. Sometimes even weeks.

As I learned more about the industry, she began trusting my work more, so the reviews got lighter. But the approval bottleneck remained brutal.

I felt like I was drowning in bureaucracy while other companies were shipping like crazy.
So I did something that could get me fired.

I created an AI employee that would represent the company across markets in two continents.

I gave her a believable name, facial traits that resonated with our ideal customer client, and a backstory with a web page.

This was years before ChatGPT made AI mainstream.

Then I started publishing content under this person's name.

The deal was to use this avatar while skipping my manager’s approval every time when no high risk was involved (guardrails were about special topics and other cases).

Over the next few years, millions of people built relationships with someone who never actually existed.

We started shipping content faster, and I could focus on experimenting instead of wasting time on bureaucracy.

People enjoyed more free educational materials while I enjoyed my day-to-day a bit more.

After I left the company, I discovered my team even had created a LinkedIn profile for my AI avatar.

I've stayed quiet about this for years because I knew it's controversial. But watching today's AI debates, I realize my little experiment was just a preview of the questions every company will face.

Would you hire a public AI employee today if it meant faster growth?
