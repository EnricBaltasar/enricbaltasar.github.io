You hired a marketer, but are paying for output you can’t publish.

I've seen it many times.

The GTM hire looked like a pro, joined your team and started marketing to a technical audience… but suddenly everything slowed down.

Emails and landing pages full of buzzwords.

What they delivered:
“Ship with confidence using a battle-tested platform.”

What your buyer actually needed:
“Know exactly what happens when requests fail or time out.”

You wouldn’t buy.
You’d probably flag it as spam.

This isn’t a talent problem.
It’s an understanding problem.

A lot of marketers struggle with technical buyers and technical products.

But they think they understand. That’s the dangerous part.

Here’s the rule:
Execution without understanding creates unusable output (or 7-round feedback loops).

Two methods that actually work:

Tip 1: Atomize onboarding

I’ve taken people with zero technical context (or even zero experience) and still gotten business results fast by shrinking the scope at the beginning.

Pick:
- one topic
- one deliverable
- one channel
- one measurable outcome

Example: a short email sequence, or a landing page rewrite.

Once they can ship that without hand-holding, you expand the scope.

If you don’t do this, you get “busy” for weeks and nothing is good enough.
(Yes, unicorns exist. No, you won’t reliably hire them.)

Tip 2: Make quality measurable

In reviews, I don’t share vibes. I score with a framework.

One simple way to start: have them rate (1–5) how well they understand the ICP and the product. Then you rate it too, and discuss the gaps.
