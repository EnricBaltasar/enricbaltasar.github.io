I've never really identified myself as a marketer.

When you study marketing, professors teach you that it's all about strategy and a lot of interconnected sub-fields. But the reality?

Most companies in the world treat marketing as Visibility, and take everything else out of their hands.

And when I moved to less developed countries, and it was easier for them to think of me as a seller than a marketer, it didn't get any better.

Don't get me wrong. I've created and managed both marketing and sales teams from scratch. But my heart doesn't belong to Visibility. I see it more as one of the gears rather than what excites me.

What I truly enjoy is being in an intersection with the product, and having ownership to make decisions. (I'm not a silo person.)

So to me, it's easier to identify myself as a builder. Because I build all sorts of systems.

I won't be offended to be called a marketer, but I just don't feel like it.
