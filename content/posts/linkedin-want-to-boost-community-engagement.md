Want to boost community engagement?

Leaders quickly crash against the invisible wall of activating members, frustrated because it’s hard to get other people to contribute, and are worried because if they disappeared tomorrow, the group would likely disappear sooner than later.

Hopefully, there’s a solution.

I spent seven years creating organisations and growing communities at local, regional, national and international levels. Along the journey, I discovered a powerful framework:

The Engagement Pyramid.

It's an actionable guide to engage your audience at any level and grow your community by avoiding the common traps only seniors learned to solve.

I've revisited the model and created a quick overview in a blog post. Find the link in the first comment.
