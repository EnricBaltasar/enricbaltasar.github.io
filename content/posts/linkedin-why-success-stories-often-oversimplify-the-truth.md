Why success stories often oversimplify the truth:

The internet loves to tell stories that sell dreams: A startup gets rejected by a buyer, only to become a billion-dollar success. The headlines call it "The Most Expensive 'No' in History".

An example? Google, which failed to be acquired by 1M, and then again for a lower 750k.

These stories go viral, fuelling entrepreneurial dreams. Thousands of likes pour in, and everyone imagines themselves as the next big hero. But let's pause for a moment.

What if the company had bought the startup in the very early days, and its leaders left soon after? Couldn't that have led to failure?

The truth is, people love these stories because they're emotional, with winners, losers, and high stakes. But they're also misleading:

Simplified narratives like these ignore the complex mix of luck, timing, and execution that drives success.

As someone once said, people like to be sold dreams.

Scientists tell us that luck plays the biggest role in success. Yet, believing luck doesn't matter much helps us improve our odds of success. It's a paradox: These stories inspire action but distort reality, and create a brighter future at the same time.

They're like optical illusions: Even when you know they aren't real, you keep seeing them. The key is recognising the illusion: Appreciating the story while keeping sight of the bigger picture.

One *needs* to be naïve enough to create a startup.
