Most CMOs don’t own GitHub. That’s a blind spot.

In devtools, discovery often happens before someone reaches a marketing site.

I found repositories ranking in the first positions for profitable developer queries, searched hundreds of times per month, without a single marketing page involved.

That visibility came from how projects were named, described, and documented inside GitHub.

These are measurable inputs with real demand behind them.
Yet in many companies, no one owns them.

When ownership is missing, demand doesn’t disappear.
It simply never enters the funnel.

I’ve been digging into how teams handle this in practice.
Happy to share more.
