It's insane how much AI accelerates feedback loops and iteration cycles.

Here there are two examples, an easy one and a complex one:

The easy one: I started re-learning Python some months ago, and found that coding is way funnier without StackOverflow. I'm so happy AI has reduced the need for this site.

Now, the complex one:

I wanted to use an algorithm to make a specific type of decision for me, so I started exploring existing products to replicate the logic. But I found that they're built on the top of too basic models (My bet: That's easier to sell for the average user due to several reasons).

So I used ChatGPT to explore and test variations, iterating on them until I had a custom algorithm that worked significantly better than existing products (literally, by a double-digit percentage).

We live in fascinating times.

Is AI helping you iterate faster?
