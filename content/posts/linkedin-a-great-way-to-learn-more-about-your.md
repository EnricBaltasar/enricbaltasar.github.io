A great way to learn more about your competitors is what I call translation-based research.

It all started when I was helping scaling a startup by opening a new market some years ago. SEO was one of the favourite channels, and the question was: Which content pieces should we push first?

The obvious answer was: We know what type of content drives most revenue in other markets, so let's use that internal knowledge. And some research later, we were leaking that information publicly -- to those who knew to read between lines.

There are multiple factors that can impact the connection, such as:
👉 The acquisition channel used in the new market. For instance, if you lead with sales activities, your translated website is likely to look different than one led by SEO. Luckily, you can check new hirings using Linkedin Sales Navigator, and check out ad libraries on Meta and Linkedin. 
👉 Market maturity (country X could be more developed than country Z for the product).
👉 Market differences.

Anyway, you put the elements together and get the insights.

After all, if you were to open a new market, would you start with your worst-performing content and ignore all you have learned in other markets? Clearly not, even if additional market research should be part of the recipe for success.

And to look back in time, a great tool to use is Archive.org. Not to mention Google Translate or DeepL to translate the pages if you don't speak the language =P.

Have fun!
