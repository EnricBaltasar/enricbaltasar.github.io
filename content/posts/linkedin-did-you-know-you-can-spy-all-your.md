Did you know you can spy all your competitors' ads across Facebook, Instagram, Google, even Tiktok? 👀

I use this a lot to:
✅ Understand how they communicate (audience stage, copy, creatives...).
✅ Discover their hidden initiatives (e.g., webinars or ebooks for specific audiences). 
✅ Learn about new opportunities.
✅ Grasp which type of audience they go after and their adaptation by channel.

Then I start my analysis meanwhile I read their landing pages, downloads their ebooks, subscribe to their crash courses, start getting emails with a ghost email, etc.

🛠️ Check out these ad libraries for paid social:
- Meta: https://lnkd.in/e_V-BmqN
- Tiktok: https://lnkd.in/eMVF9EhQ
- Linkedin: https://lnkd.in/e7nXshJr

🛠️ You can use Ahrefs (paid) for Google Ads. Just do this:
1. Type the website of your competitor and click Enter.
2. Go to section "Paid search", then head to: Paid keywords / Ads / Paid pages.

The strong beauty of the last one is you can discover many potentially transactional keywords and relevant landing pages that might be hidden.
