Can GitHub be your biggest user acquisition channel?

I’ve broken down Oxylabs.io’ GitHub strategy and found a repeatable playbook most devtools are sleeping on:

– how they use repositories to rank on Google and LLMs for buying-intent keywords
– the developer experience they create inside their repos to drive signups

It’s a roadmap to turn open-source repos into a user acquisition channel.

If you run a devtool, this will show you what’s possible and where Oxylabs is still leaving money on the table (so you don’t).

I recorded a full breakdown with all the examples and improvement points.

👉 Full breakdown (with examples + improvement points) is in the comments.
