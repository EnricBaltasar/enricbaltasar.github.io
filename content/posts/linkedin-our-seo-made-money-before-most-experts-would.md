Our SEO made money before most “experts” would have finished keyword research.

Most SEO starts with the wrong question:
“Which keywords should we rank for?”

Sometimes it’s dressed up as:
“Which topics should we cover?”

So you publish a ton, wait 6 months for “results” (usually signups, not revenue), and run out of patience before ROI shows up.

The better starting point:
“Where does our ICP’s workflow break?”

Keywords aren’t the starting point. They’re the translation.

My red flag for SEO (in-house or agency):
If they don’t ask real questions about the product and customer journey on day one, they’ll ship a generic playbook.

And generic SEO is expensive noise.
