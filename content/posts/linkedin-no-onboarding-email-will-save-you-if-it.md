No onboarding email will save you if it takes 17 clicks and several tries to get value.

A founder told me: "We've got revenue. Now we just need more marketing. More onboarding emails. New product tour videos. Maybe a walkthrough.".

Red flag.

I signed up for their product.

17 clicks and several minutes just to figure out how to succeed, even with prior knowledge.
A competitor? 2 clicks and 10 seconds. For everybody.

That's not a marketing problem.
That's a broken product experience.

Because most onboarding problems aren't email problems. They're product problems. 
Root disease > Symptoms.

The best onboarding isn't an email but the product itself, making users feel progress.
The rest is either a booster or a bad fit.

Many founders think that "If we've got this far, it means we just need more activities".

I don't sell Band-Aids. I build and optimize systems.
Exponential > Incremental.

Life's too short to spend it on tiny problems and atomized ownership.
