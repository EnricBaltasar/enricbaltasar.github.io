This is how developer products grow adoption.

After studying 120+ top devtools, I created a framework for turning docs into a growth engine, from AI discovery through revenue.

Then I built the first free assessment tool. It scores you across ten goals, shows what's blocking visibility and activation, and tells you exactly what to fix.

Companies like Mintlify already ran theirs.
