What if we made 367,000+ people learn a made-up language on Duolingo? 🤯

Sounds wild, right? That’s exactly what we did with and it turned into a viral community success.

But the real secret wasn’t just about getting people to sign up. It was about:

✅ Partnering with Duolingo to boost course completion rates
✅ Activating learners by making them a part of a global community
✅ Doubling down on growth strategies and refining along the way

📈 Result? 367,000+ active learners and counting!

In my new article, I break down the step-by-step strategy I used to grow this course and the key lessons for building learning communities.
