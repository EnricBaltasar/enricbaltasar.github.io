You believe you understand your customers, but you don't. This is what happened to me. 
 
A technical startup I worked at put me in an interesting frontline to create new ad campaigns end-to-end, from idea to writing, designing, even talking to the Sales team so that I'd go beyond data. 
 
Plus, I'd be getting constant feedback from both the CMO and a domain expert. So cool! 
 
The problem? 
 
Almost everything I came up with was crap. The corrections and disqualifications lined up every single week, month after month. And the experience remained the same when working on other channels. 
 
Honestly, I was often wondering why I hadn't got fired yet. Just imagine how much frustration and time waste I was probably bringing to her life! 
 
I tried to progress as fast as I could, but I never reached a point at which I felt confident about seeing the big picture. I was like putting bricks together but had no idea if I was building a house or a well. 
 
Until something happened... 
 
One day, the CMO showed me a very simple spreadsheet with three columns: 
· Feature 
· Advantage 
· Benefit 
 
Now, think of a car. A feature is what your product has (air conditioning), an advantage is how it helps (control the temperature), and a benefit is what the customer gets (increase overall well-being). 
 
As I started to read the file, I got brightness in my eyes, and could hear a enlightenment melody in my ears. The pieces started to fit together! 
 
Three silly columns in a spreadsheet helped me quickly start to see a lot fewer red colour in my proposals, ask smarter questions and improve my guessing on where gold might hide. 
 
Over time, I learned this model was prone to breaking in multiple cases yet figured out several solutions. For example, in technical industries, I often picture functionality as feature-capability, mostly when onboarding new teammates, to help them map capabilities.
