I deleted 21 blog posts the day before publishing.

They were finished and scheduled, but none of them solved a real pain for our ICP.

When I asked the team why we were writing them, no one could answer.

That's when I realized: we weren't doing content marketing. We were doing content operations.

Don't hire a content agency. Hire someone obsessed with your product.

A bad agency will give you 10 blog posts a month.
A great one will give you zero. Until they understand.

Understand what?
Your product. Your market. Your customer.

Drop one, and performance suffers because of mismatched search intent, content that doesn't convert, etc.

So I paused the entire pipeline.

The team and CEO weren't happy. But traffic doesn't matter if it doesn't convert.

I built a framework to make the team to identify and quantify ICP pain before any idea got validated.

Not: "Is this keyword relevant?"
But: "Is this solving a problem a buyer is fighting against? And which one?"

That's how we moved from activity to impact.
From blog factory to growth engine.

And in technical industries, this gap is even worse.

Marketers often lack the product depth to prioritize what matters.
And engineers don't have time to teach them.

So I built internal tools to close the gap. Tools that surfaced user struggles, tied content to high-intent triggers, and removed everything else.
