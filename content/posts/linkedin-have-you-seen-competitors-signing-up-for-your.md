Have you seen competitors signing up for your product and webinars?

Many insiders react with fear by blocking them, believing it helps. But that's worse than taking no action. You should avoid that mistake. 

Instead, if it happens, it's actually amazing. It means you're relevant. And since excitement blocks fear (psychologically speaking), that's exactly how you should perceive it.

⭐ Now, let me share some competitor intelligence insights that I wish someone had taught me. This will help you track your competitors better, or spy on them in ways that'll impress your team.

Let's start by defining that there's a ladder of sophistication among the people working for your competitors:
1. Super-leakers
2. Guardians
3. Geniuses

FIRST of all, the super-leakers are those who sign up using their business email in their business browser.

Honestly, unless they want to approach a partnership with you, they're making a huge mistake. Please, take advantage of this.

I know it might be weird e.g. to hold a webinar while knowing three guys from competing businesses are listening to every pearl you're sharing, but get used to it for the better. In the meantime, you can:
- Set up alerts for when they get back to your product (and trust me, most will) to see what they explored.
- Create a list of contacts in your CRM to group them.

In my experience, all competing companies will have super-leakers regardless of any internal policies (which tend not to exist anyway).

SECOND, the guardians are those who try to hide their identity with tactics that range between bad, ok-ish, and good. Some examples are Chrome's incognito mode (guys, that mode is a joke), or using a fake personal email (positive point for you).

If you have a professional CRM, you'll get some of them identified because of technical reasons they ignore. Also, more advanced users might make mistakes over time, so some will be spotted at some point.

THIRD, let's talk about the geniuses:

They're people who use anti-detect browsers with proxies, such as Gologin or Multilogin, so that you can't spot them, and to avoid casual mistakes. This costs a few bucks but it's more trustworthy, and you can share logins with teammates.

Another tactic is creating a fake mini-website (what about using v0.dev for that?) to get a functional and real-looking business email. The reason for this is companies segment with this factor, and will send you emails others won't receive.

One last tactic geniuses use is becoming a customer insider. That means they pay for your product to get exclusive access to product betas and communications to stay ahead and react faster.

Hope it helps. Enjoy exploring.
