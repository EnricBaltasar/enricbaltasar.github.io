What happened when 150+ university students were asked about a product?

I ran a survey asking them to describe the product I was researching. After categorising the responses, the graph was clear:

Not pretty answers.

The majority pointed out the same 2-3 negative traits. But why? What shaped their opinion?

Diving deeper in the survey, I discovered an eye-opening insight:

There was a common pattern in their learning journey: Google. So, I analysed the search structure and noticed almost all the traffic was awareness-related, with a specific Wikipedia page as the clear winner. And here’s the kicker: 

There was a striking correlation between their negative views and how that Wikipedia article framed the product.

This page was shaping perceptions. I knew I had to do something about it to gain control over the influence.

It was the turn for adventurous Wikipedia marketing! I warmed up my account by making contributions over time to other articles, and then I targeted the one. I revisited the article introduction (what really needed a change) while also adding changes in other parts of the article.

It worked! ✅

My new product framing is still live today.

But I didn’t stop there. I wanted to know how many people I was impacting more precisely. After finding an official stats page, I discovered the article averaged 17,465 views per month. That's 209,574 views annually.

It goes to show Analysis > Action sometimes. Don't "just do it".
