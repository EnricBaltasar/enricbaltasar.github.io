Get 1,000 people to your signup page. Watch 600 leave forever.

Apify does something smart to fight this.

They have a marketplace where you browse different tools. When you click on one and decide to sign up, they don't throw you into a generic form.

Instead, they keep that specific tool visible on the signup page. So you see the "candy" you want, plus supporting social proof (122K users, 4.6 rating) and key benefits ("Don't worry about blocking", "Integrate your favourite tools").

No "Wait, what was I signing up for again?".

Here's what's interesting: they placed the form on the right and context on the left, opposite of the typical conversion advice. Not following conventions boosted them to $27M in ARR.

Context-aware intent like this is how you reduce signup drop-off.

Have you seen other examples worth sharing?

P.S. I implemented this over the weekend. Surprisingly easy to add.
