Would you put your credit card on this website?

That’s my test for SaaS founders who obsess over pretty designs. A website is supposed to make money.

The real questions are:

Does it load fast so LLMs and Google don’t discard you?

Is it optimized for SEO so people can find you?

Does the UI alone make your product look trustworthy?

A SaaS website isn’t a designer’s portfolio.

Sure, add some color and typography that reflect your brand. Put your own take on design.

But don’t confuse looking “cool” with being effective. A site that builds trust does more for your growth than a site that just looks pretty.

If you’re bootstrapping, lean on patterns users already know. Buttons should look like buttons. Links like links.

Stop chasing every flashy UI trend. Spend that energy on your product.
Would you pay on your own site?
