DESIGN:
>>> TRY TO REPLICATE THEME (create new theme) based on files we have of WP of enricbaltasar.com


IMAGES:
>> https://enricbaltasar.com/vicent-andres-estelles-esperanto/ images are small (we used the same size as in the blog). Can we save also the biggest version and link to it? I think for many images we have bigger sizes in the WordPress backup (and probably needs to be target blank, although better to show modal or something instead of opening new page), just like discoveryfund.com
// -min
// public_html/wp-content/uploads/
>> all images in a single folder, not by year


MEDIA:
split by type (e.g., pdf), not date


JS:
>>>> GOOGLE ANALYTICS


DNS/CDN:
>>> cloudflare: trailing slashes
>>> rewrite urls --> choose strategy, then redirect with CF
