I once opened up my grandma's sewing machine to see what was inside.

Took it apart. Studied every piece.

Then I put the parts back.

Hours later, from the other room:

“Enriiiiiiiic!!".

I froze.

"Did you touch my sewing machine?".

She didn't need proof.
She already knew.

That's how I've always learned.

By looking under the hood.

I take things apart.
Not to break them (though no promises).
But to understand them.

I've done that since forever.

As a teenager, I did it with HTML.
Visit web page → Right-click → View Source → Copy, tweak, test.

Now I do it with growth.
Funnels. Positioning. Products.

Why does this landing page convert?
How do they make customers upgrade?
What are they doing that they're not saying?

That's what reverse-engineering means to me:
Start with what's working.
Break it down.
Work backwards from the result to the principle.

It's how I:
- Doubled lead generation.
- Boosted user activation.
- Scaled revenue-driving playbooks.

And here's the part no one tells you:

Manuals are written after the magic happens.

If you wait for the official guide, you're already late.

Growth isn't just creative.
It's forensic.

You don't always need a map.
Sometimes the fastest way to learn is... to take things apart.

What I did as a kid,
I still do.
