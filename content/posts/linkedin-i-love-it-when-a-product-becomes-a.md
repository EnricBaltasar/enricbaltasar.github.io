I love it when a product becomes a community.

It comes in many formats: A Discord channel, a biweekly online Q&A, etc. But nothing beats the high engagement and impact of local events. That's why you find people asking for city-based channels on e.g. Slack communities from time to time.

A great example is HubSpot User Groups, where experienced customers help newcomers learn the basics, do deep dives into how to achieve a benefit using a specific feature or discover market trend insights.

Of course, everything is connected to the product or movement in one way or another, creating a growth loop and building a stronger network.

The challenge?

Creating local groups presents a set of obstacles: Who will lead? Who will spread the word? And so on.

However, going from a product to a community creates a huge advantage. Think about it:
- Organiser → Agencies and freelancers who already use your product to make money, and can use these events to generate new customers for themselves by positioning themselves as experts.
- Distribution → The platform already has a huge database with well-segmented audiences and communication specialists.

Note: I'll approach this topic from a different perspective in a future post.
